# MyJikanBot

This Discord Bot uses the JDA wrapper to retrieve information from the Jikan API and take anime/manga information for users to find. The commands now include searching for their favorite anime or manga, finding a random manga or anime, fnding out the schedule for each day of the week, finding the top anime or manga(even more subtypes), and popular anime for a season.

If you wish to join my Discord Server with the MyJikanBot then please contact me at this email:                         mus2003.abdul@gmail.com
